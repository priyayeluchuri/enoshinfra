          <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-6">How to Set Up Your IT Startup in Bengaluru: A Step-by-Step Guide</h1>
          <p className="text-lg mb-6">Bengaluru, known as India's Silicon Valley, is the ideal destination for IT startups. Here's a detailed guide on setting up your tech business with the right office spaces and resources.</p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">1. Define Your Office Requirements</h2>
          <p className="text-lg mb-4">Begin by understanding the specific needs of your IT startup. Consider whether you need a <strong>professional office space</strong>, a <strong>coworking space</strong>, or a <strong>private lease</strong>. Evaluate the size, location preferences, and budget to ensure you select an office that supports both growth and productivity.</p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">2. Select the Ideal Location</h2>
          <p className="text-lg mb-4">Bengaluru's key tech hubs like Whitefield, Electronic City, and Outer Ring Road offer excellent options. Proximity to talent pools, transportation, and tech parks is essential. Consider <strong>economic office solutions</strong> that don't compromise on location advantages, ensuring easy access for clients and employees alike.</p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">3. Evaluate Infrastructure and Connectivity</h2>
          <p className="text-lg mb-4">Ensure the property is equipped with high-speed internet, modern facilities, and seamless connectivity to major roads and highways. This ensures better collaboration and smoother client visits. Properties near major transit points or connected to the city’s metro system can offer added convenience.</p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">4. Cost Analysis and Flexibility</h2>
          <p className="text-lg mb-4">Startups thrive on flexibility. Look for lease agreements that allow for scaling up as the business grows. Choose <strong>economic office spaces</strong> that offer high value in terms of cost, location, and amenities. Timing is crucial; secure spaces that align with your launch and operational goals.</p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">5. Collaborate with Experts</h2>
